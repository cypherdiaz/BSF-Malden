**Bandits.sqf**
<BR>Diff: Moderate; AI:4-6; Spawns Non-Pr Reward Vic from DMS_ArmedVehicles; No Patrol; No Static; Spawns normal crate.
<BR>Use: Could repurpose to reward a random persistent armed vic like a Prowler/Qilin/LandRover

**bauhaus.sqf**
<BR>Diff: Difficult; AI:6-8; Spawns 2 crates, one of which focuses on building supplies; No Patrol; No Static; No Reward Vic.
<BR>Use:  Could be used to demonstrate dropping 2 crates or how to specify a crate using a singular drop table. Maybe use to drop multiple crates full of totally random stuff?

**beertransport.sqf**
<BR>Diff:Easy; AI:3-5; No Patrol; No Static; No Reward Vic; Normal Crate with gauranteed beer inside of it.
<BR>Use: Filler mission maybe? Otherwise useless. Would need to neuter the crate.

**behindenemylines.sqf**
<BR>Diff: Easy; AI:2-4; No Patrol; No Static; No Reward Vic; Normal Crate; Does spawn a sandbag bunker though.
<BR>Use: Filler? Maybe make a beefed up version with a base included?

**blackhawkdown.sqf**
<BR>Diff: Difficult; AI:6-8; No Patrol, No Static, No Reward Vic; Normal Crate
<BR>Use: Filler?

**cardealer.sqf**
<BR>Diff: Easy; AI:3-5; No Patrol; No Static; Two Non-Pr Vic Rewards; Normal Crate; Spawns a building.

**construction.sqf**
<BR>Diff: Hardcore; AI:5-7; No Patrol; No Static; Spawns Non-Pr Vic Reward using extraparams circuit. Spawns extra pallets. Customized(items) crate.
<BR>Use: Method of crate custom is interesting. The vic spawn is also interesting but meh. The extra pallets do add to the mission atmosphere though.

<BR>Diff: Difficult; AI:6-8; No Patrol; 2 Statics; Spawns Non-Pr Vic Reward using extraparams circuit. Basic crate.
<BR>Use: Not much?

<BR>Diff: Hardcore; AI:6-8; 1 Patrol, 1 Static, No Reward Vic, Special "Sniper" crate, Special baseobjs "base1" attachment.

<BR>Use: Importing base objects. Variable Difficulty setup (Variable loot & AI Count). IF Hardcore logic circuit for persistent vehicle; could be stacked. New style of customized crate contents.

**nedcar_mission.sqf**
<BR>This mission is actually really messed up. Supposed to reward nicer vics for hardcore, but then it cant spawn as hardcore? What.
<BR>Use: Another example of IF Hardcore logic circuit, this time with randomization via a pool of possibilities. Other then that, what not to do.

**nedguns1_mission.sqf**
<BR>This mission is almost identical to nedbuilding1_mission.sqf except guns vs building materials.

**nedhatchback_mission.sqf**

**nedresearch_mission.sqf**
<BR>Diff:Variable; AI: Variable; Custom crate weapon & item list. Building hook. Per vehicle on hardcore.

**thieves.sqf**
<BR>Use: Handy way to choose a persistent vehicle to spawn from a separate list (DMS_CarThieves). 

**walmart.sqf**
<BR>Use: Interesting spawning of a base without doing a _baseObjs.  And it just spawns a lot of random items, nothing special.
