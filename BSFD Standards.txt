BS-Free Server Document Standard

*These standards currently apply to the following:
													Defents Mission System
													
													
*The goal of these standards is to organize all of the classname lists in the above files.
*Instead of a trigger calling to a specific class name, it will call to a SQF document and will use #include to hook it together.


*Files following this standard:
								Weapons_Static.sqf			//This file houses all possible Static Weapons possibly chosen from for AI Missions using DMS.
